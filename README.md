Pavani's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built with HTML and CSS (a bit javascript) â€” inspired by pastel themes, clean UI, and my love for coding & logic building.
This is a very basic project made by me to dive and clear my concepts of HTML and CSS. 
I will keep upgrading the site as and when i learn new skills to make this a better portfolio.
